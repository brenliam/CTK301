    <p> <a href=assignment7.html>This is a link.</a> Careful. There goes the next Shadow Broker. She was the smartest and strongest. She would not accept the injustice thrust upon her. She fought to the end. I am so proud of her, Shepard. It'd be an awfully empty galaxy without you. This is not your domain. You have breached the darkness. Call me princess again and you'll be picking your teeth up off the floor. Females were obviously dying. Barbaric experiments. Maelon's fault. My responsibility to fix. Need to save them. No more, No more dead.</p>

    <p> <a href=assignment7.html>This is a link.</a> Did they have anything that you could eat there? Find peace in the embrace of the goddess. Trapped inside a Reaper. Could be worse. Don't know how, but I guess it could be full of rats. A suicide mission. Yes. A suicide mission will do nicely. Your superiors are sending you to certain death for no good reason. You have a right to disobey. I'm good, Shepard! Ready for anything! We live, we'll get loud, spill some drinks on the Citadel! </p>

    <p> <a href=assignment7.html>This is a link.</a> Hell, Garrus, you were always ugly. Slap some face-paint on there, and no one will even notice. I'll relinquish one bullet. Where do you want it? That's easy for you to say. We've both been engineered for greatness. The difference is, you were great before we rebuilt you. I'm great because of it. And I gave you the moral support to dodge them. You're breaking the law for bribe money. You know what we do to dirty cops on my world? Just once I'd like to ask someone for help and hear them say, 'Sure. Let's go. Right now. No strings attached. </p>
